# Visualization in HCI / 05-499/05-899 Section C Homework 0

**Due: Friday, January 20, 11:59 pm.**

Welcome to Visualization in HCI.  In this class, we will be using a variety of tools that will require some initial configuration. To ensure everything goes smoothly moving forward, we will setup the majority of those tools in this homework.  This homework will not be graded **except** for Problem 2. In Problem 2 you set up git and github for this course, which is essential before starting with HW 1.

## Problem 1 - Class Survey, Signups, and Introduction

### Sign up for github

You'll be using git and [GitHub](http://github.com) to manage homework assignments and projects.

Sign up for a github account (if you don't already have one) and request a free account upgrade [on this page](https://education.github.com/). You'll need to verify ownership of an **.edu e-mail address** if you didn't sign up with your .edu account.

This educational student developer pack will enable you to create unlimited private repositories. We will need these for the class.

**It is important that you complete this step quickly, as it may take a while for github to provide you with the repositories. Make sure to request a .edu e-mail address if you don't already have one.**

### Class Survey
Please complete the [course survey located here](https://goo.gl/forms/NKXnkTksR2cMd9jY2). It should only take a few moments of your time. It is imperative that you fill out the survey on time.

### Slack
We will use Slack as a forum for discussion, to find team members, to arrange appointments, and to ask questions. Slack should be your primary form of communication with the instructor and other students. Use the e-mail only for individual requests, e.g., to inform us if you're sick for an exam, etc. If you ask a general question via e-mail, we will ask you to ask it on Slack instead.

Go to [cmu-vis-course Slack](https://cmu-vis-course.slack.com/signup) and sign up for the class using your CMU e-mail address. If you don't (yet) have an official e-mail address, send an e-mail to [cmu.vis.course@gmail.com](mailto:cmu.vis.course@gmail.com) with the subject "Slack Access: your@e.mail".  

### Introduction

Once you are signed up for Slack, introduce yourself to your classmates and course staff in the #general channel. Include your name/nickname, your affiliation, why you are taking this course, and tell us something interesting about yourself (e.g., an unusual hobby, past travels, or a cool project you did, etc.).  Also tell us whether you have experience with visualization.

## Problem 2 - Introduction to Git

Attend the lecture on git and [follow the instructions on the homework](http://cmu-vis-course.github.io/2017/homework/) on setting up your **private** git repository for the homework. This involves creating a repository, sharing it with our github user [cmu-vis-instructor](https://github.com/cmu-vis-instructor), and announcing your project repository through [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/bnEOhXLAHT1EHaTp1). Be sure to follow all the instructions on the homework page!

Edit the `README.md` file at the root of your repository to add your name and email address. Commit your changes.

In the `hw0` directory, add a text file named `hw0.md`. The text file can be empty. Commit and push your changes.

This part of your homework will be graded, so make sure that your github repository conforms to our naming guidelines, you submitted your repository url, you shared it, and that you successfully pushed everything.

**Log in to the GitHub website to ensure everything shows up correctly!**

## Problem 3 - Introduction to HTML, CSS

**There is no need to hand anything in â€” this is an exercise and you can check whether you understood the concepts.**

Take this [quiz](http://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=HTML) to test your HTML knowledge, and this [one](http://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=CSS) to evaluate your understanding of CSS. If you feel confident, you can try the [JavaScript quiz](http://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=JavaScript).
