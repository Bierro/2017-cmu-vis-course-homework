# Visualization in HCI Homework 1

## Introduction to Git

Attend the lecture on git and [follow the instructions](../lectures/lecture-git/) on setting up your **private** git repository for the homework. This involves creating a repository, sharing it with our github user [cmu-vis-instructor](https://github.com/cmu-vis-instructor), and announcing your project repository through [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/bnEOhXLAHT1EHaTp1). Be sure to follow all the instructions!

Edit the `README.md` file at the root of your repository to add your name and email address. Commit your changes.

In the `hw1` directory, add a text file named `hw1.md`. The text file can be empty. Commit and push your changes.

This part of your homework will be graded, so make sure that your github repository conforms to our naming guidelines, you submitted your repository url, you shared it, and that you successfully pushed everything.

**Log in to the GitHub website to ensure everything shows up correctly!**

## Introduction to HTML, CSS

**There is no need to hand anything in â€” this is an exercise and you can check whether you understood the concepts.**

Take this [quiz](http://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=HTML) to test your HTML knowledge, and this [one](http://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=CSS) to evaluate your understanding of CSS. If you feel confident, you can try the [JavaScript quiz](http://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=JavaScript).
